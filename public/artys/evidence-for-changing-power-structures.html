          <h1>Evidence for changing power structures</h1>
          <p class="article-heading-secondary">Continuing to answer why we need design-bias product decisions.</p>
          <p>Authored on June 27, 2020. Updated on February 15, 2021.</p>
        </header>

        <p>My plan from last time was to move forward from <a href="./expose-decisions-to-redistribute-power.html">the <em>why</em> of exposing decisions to redistribute power</a>. A bit more than a month later, and I don't feel ready to move on from the <em>why</em>. There's too much unsaid (and unacted) about the intersections between technology, racism, and information architecture to move on quite yet.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/cityeq/a-note-from-marquise-stillwell-black-designer-and-business-owner-to-other-leaders-out-there-3068c96f7881">recent article</a>, Marquise Stillwell states:</p>

        <blockquote class="arty-blockquote">"...I challenge you to be vulnerable: give up your power. To end systemic racism, <strong>we need an equity-focused approach that redistributes power to include those who lack it</strong>."</blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://medium.com/cityeq/a-note-from-marquise-stillwell-black-designer-and-business-owner-to-other-leaders-out-there-3068c96f7881">Read Stillwell's full article.</a> Go. I'll wait.</p>

        <p>Back? Good.</p>

        <p>Stillwell is appealing to the leaders of organizations. <a href="./expose-decisions-to-redistribute-power.html">My previous article</a> is appealing to influencers of organizational leaders. I point this out for a very specific reason. <em>Why?</em></p>

        <h2>Redistributing power is culture change, and culture change requires strategy.</h2>

        <p>The redistribution of power, that both Stillwell and myself speak of, is cultural change. Successful culture change, for a more equitable future for all, requires a strategy. Implementing this strategy, through some sort of framework, gets us from the culture we have to the culture that we envision.</p>

        <p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692225587">Intertwingled</a>, Peter Morville talks of five levers* for successful culture change:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Information</strong>: the raw knowledge needed for change*</li>
          <li><strong>Behavior</strong>: the habits required to seed and sustain change*</li>
          <li><strong>Context</strong>: the empathy to understand why change is needed*</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership</strong>: the authority that guides change*</li>
          <li><strong>All of the above</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>* I am paraphrasing in my own words, as my recollection of exact terminology and phrasing Morville uses is likely inaccurate 5 years after reading the book.</em></p>

        <p>According to Morville, successful culture change comes from a community that "pulls" all five levers at once.</p>

        <p>Stillwell, appealing to leaders, is pulling lever four. My articles, appealing to <a href="./on-the-future-of-design-leadership.html">influencers</a>, intend to help pull levers one, two, and three. Thus, we now have a strategy to enact all five levers, and succeed with changing culture for the better.</p>

        <p>The next question becomes <em>how</em> do we implement this strategy? What <em>framework</em> does an organization use? Now we're circling back to the specific decisions I listed out in <a href="./expose-decisions-to-redistribute-power.html">the previous article</a>, and a question of <em>how</em> we use such a framework in practice. I will address this in future articles.</p>

        <h2>A working thesis.</h2>

        <p>At this point, it's time to revisit and evolve what might be closer to my intended thesis of <em>why</em>. There's still more to unpack here: points of clarification, intersections to expose, and unstated details of both theory and practice. With that out of the way...</p>

        <p>Organizations need design-bias product decisions so that they may:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Leverage a framework to implement a strategy of successful product creation culture change</li>
          <li>Leverage the discipline of design as a facilitator of this change</li>
          <li>Redistribute power within and across project/product teams as a result of this change</li>
          <li>Open up opportunities to become inclusive to all</li>
          <li>Rebuild away from privileged systems and systems of oppression</li>
          <li>Begin unravelling <a href="https://hashtagcauseascene.com/podcast/tech-is-not-neutral-ep-1/">non-neutral technology</a></li>
          <li>Start showing, in practice, the evidence that Stillwell desires to see...</li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote class="arty-blockquote">"I want to see action, not branded corporate messages that go nowhere. <strong>I want to see evidence that organizations are applying the same critical thinking they bring to their work towards changing their existing power structures</strong> — because that is what will lead to authentic, lasting change."</blockquote>

        <h2>A post-article muse</h2>

        <p>My current livelihood partly depends on me pulling the first three levers of culture change as described above.</p>

        <p>The unstated responsibility is this: time and time again, I am to repackage information, behaviors, and collaborative activities so that positive change can come from the bottom-up. When I find something that 'sticks', I have to encourage it's growth; keep experimenting on the vocabulary, the practices, and the activities that brings more progress to teams than has previously been achieved. I have to persuade and encourage culture change. Yet sometimes, things aren't too... sticky.</p>

        <p>The reason that failure happens comes down either to my poor execution, or because a lack of the fourth lever. While I most certainly have had moments of poor execution, lack of leadership is a very real thing. One way I want to communicate the description of lack of leadership is with <a href="https://www.theroot.com/the-black-persons-guide-to-game-of-thrones-1796847562">The Black Person’s Guide to Game of Thrones by Michael Harriot</a>. Essentially, since corporate america can be said to be a ruthless system of white privilege, this white-on-white 'violence' creates waves of weak leadership that leaves oppression in its wake.</p>
