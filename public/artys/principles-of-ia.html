        <p>Information architecture (IA) is a discipline that helps teams create meaningful relationships between <a href="./expose-decisions-to-redistribute-power.html">core decisions of software products</a>.</p>

        <p>With this definition, IA is a required <a href="http://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/chapter/1/identify-the-mess/">"making sense of messes" skill set</a> for individuals, project teams, and organizations that desire to reach a higher level of design maturity.</p>

        <p>In an effort to improve the quality of IA within software products, these are the five principles of IA that I have found most useful.</p>

        <h2>The principles</h2>

        <h3>1. Minimize user types</h3>
        <p>A project team should strive to define scope to a minimum number of core user types. Start with one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3>2. Minimize user goals</h3>
        <p>A project team should strive to define scope to a minimum number of user goals per user type. Start with one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3>3. Minimize user goals per page</h3>
        <p>A project team should strive to define scope to a minimum number of user goals per page of a product. Start with one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3>4. Content follows user goals</h3>
        <p>Product content should answer “what” information helps a person achieve their goal.</p>

        <h3>5. Distribute content over time</h3>
        <p>Product content should be distributed in a product over time to take a person through a sequence that meaningfully accomplishes their goal.</p>

        <hr />

        <p>Generally, these principles help scope products and focus teams. Additionally, the can act as a high-level evaluation to frame the state of a mature product.</p>

        <p>Such clarity of scope and foucs helps <em>tremendously</em> with operational decisions of a team or organization:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to size teams</li>
          <li>How and when to scale teams</li>
          <li>How much teams can handle</li>
          <li>What team compositions should be</li>
          <li>How to keep work managable</li>
          <li>How and when to move from problems to solutions</li>
          <li>How to plan the finances</li>
          <li>How to measure success</li>
          <li>Likely more...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the future, I plan to write playbook activities that use these principles in practice, since these principles begin to enable the enactment of a <a href="./expose-decisions-to-redistribute-power.html">design-bias product decision framework</a>.</p>
