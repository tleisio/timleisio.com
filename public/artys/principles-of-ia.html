        <h2 class="arty-h2">Peeling the "why" layers of the onion slowly away to begin revealing the "how" of design-bias product decisions.</h2>

        <p class="arty-p">Information architecture (IA) is a discipline that creates relationships between all core decisions to creating product experiences.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">IA is also a critical <a href="http://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/chapter/1/identify-the-mess/">community-based skill</a> that is required to transition an organization to a more mature design state.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">This is true even with design systems. IA enables a design system to transition from mere component libraries toward the efficient cultural collaboration of <em>how</em> teams create products together.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">So, in an effort to articulate and raise awareness of a standard level of IA quality that embeds itself into products within organizations, I've written five principles of IA.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">1. Minimize personas</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Any product should strive to define and scope itself to a minimum number of core personas. Start at one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">2. Minimize user goals</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Any product should strive to define and scope itself to a minimum number of user goals per persona. Start with one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">3. Minimize user goals per page</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Any product should strive to define and scope itself to a minimum number of user goals per page. Start with one, and only increase as absolutely necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">4. Content follows user goals</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Product content should reflect personas' goals in a way that answers “what” information helps a person achieve goal success.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">5. Sequence content over time</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Product content should be sequenced over time in a way that answers the “when” and “where” information best helps a person achieve goal success.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">As I alluded to in the beginning, these principles support and use the design-bias decisions for creating products. In using these as common vocabulary terms, project teams enable themselves to ensure a fair distribution of power as they create products.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">This benefit is extended, and thus amplified, when considering the promotion of these prinicples through a design system. Now, every project team that uses these principles are setting themselves up with high-level decision guiding points that focus and improve product quality.</p>
