    <section>
      <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my site.</p>
      <p>I am currently a User Experience (UX) Lead at Thomson Reuters, specializing in information architecture, currently employed at Thomson Reuters.</p>
      <p>In my day-to-day, you'll find me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading and facilitating research efforts to understand people</li>
        <li>Leading and facilitating co-collaborative activities that create alignment between people</li>
        <li>Heads down; mulling over chaotic information in order create compelling narratives that achieve the goals of both businesses and constituents</li>
        <li>Promoting consistency in shared language, understanding, and action</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While I am extremely thankful and happy that my time, for the last 9 years, has been taken by designing software products, my interests elsewhere are beyond a critical tipping point.</p>
      <p>If the skills above are in need, those at the intersection of regenerative development or agriculture, social equality, climate justice, and local government are encouraged to send inquiries to <a href="mailto:timothyleisio@gmail.com">timothyleisio@gmail.com</a>, or reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timleisio/">linkedin</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/timleisio">twitter</a>. I'm eager to take action.</p>
