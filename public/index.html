        <h2>Work (and other activity)</h2>
        <p>I work on a design system these days for Thomson Reuters. I'm keen to lead and facilitate operational (internal) collaborative activities. Opportunties with this are currently looking optimisic. Especially with the desire to infuse and embed equity-centered design practices within the Thomson Reuters design system. Time will tell. I have a high bar of others.</p>
        <p>What else am I up to these days?</p>
