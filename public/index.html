        <h1 class="arty-h1">Expose decisions to redistribute power.</h1>
        <h2 class="arty-h2">The "why" behind design-bias product decisions.</h2>
        <p class="arty-psmall">May 17, 2020</p>
        <hr class="arty-hr" />
        <p class="arty-p">Building a software product can be broken down into core decisions. These may vary for the teams you work with. Likely, they <em>should</em>. Frameworks like this are intended to flex to the context of your organization. Regardless, this is a set of design-bias product decisions that I've found work best for the teams I work with.</p>

        <h3 class="arty-h3">Core decisions of a software product</h3>
        <ol class="arty-ol">
          <li>Business goals</li>
          <li>User goals</li>
          <li>Content</li>
          <li>Workflow</li>
          <li>Presentation (features)</li>
          <li>Technology</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="arty-p">There is much to be said about this particular set of decisions as a strategy and practice, but I find it most important to first articulate the <em>why</em>. <em>Why</em> does this exist, and <em>why</em> does it need to be articulated?

        <h3 class="arty-h3">Power</h3>

        <p class="arty-p">The primary motivation behind this framework is the redistribution of power within teams and organizations.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">Teams that create products do better when all team members feel they have appropriate responsibilities that match both their desire and skill level. Said again more succinctly, teams do better when power is equalized.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">Unfortunatley, and especially within larger enterprise organizations, there is often a large gap between responsiblities and the human potential of team members. These gaps are often found in tandem with those that have too much responsibility and too much power. Thus, inequality pervades, and organizations see retention of talent fall.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">I've lamented to others on such inequalities before. If a team or organization can be thought of as three lenses of a Venn diagram - one lens for each of business, design, and technology - it is often the design lens that lacks realized responsibilities. It is the design lens that never realizes the human potential of those employees. It is the design lens that lacks power.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">To expose this framework is to introduce a new, shared language to your team (and organization) that informs how you can more equitably make product decisions in a way that does not undermine the aspirations or motivations of the team.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">To expose this framework is to expose these inequalities of power.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">Inequality of power within software product creation is real. I experience a little. I see and hear others live it much more, and it is infuriating.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">What does power inequality look like?</p>

        <ul class="arty-ul">
          <li>It looks like bringing objective evidence and facts to a team and having these facts be reacted to as a personal attack.</li>
          <li>It looks like bringing your strengths and expertise to the situation, only to have it be disregarded because of fear.</li>
          <li>It looks like being openly hopeful for a better future to those who should support you, but to have them deflect and disregard.</li>
          <li>It looks like being attacked for doing what you know to be right.</li>
          <li>It looks like experimentation and learning being treated worse than complacency.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="arty-p">All of this is cultural in nature. It is also heavily steeped in privilege.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">This is the reason and need for a more nuanced, design-bias framework of product decisions.</p>

        <p class="arty-p">From here, and for now, I leave you with these four questions to begin the process of instigating change:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>What are our team's core decisions?</li>
          <li>Who is currently responsible for what decisions?</li>
          <li>What is unfair and to whom?</li>
          <li>What steps do we take, together, from here?</li>
        </ol>

        <h1 class="arty-h1">How to design a table without complexity</h1>
        <h2 class="arty-h2">Draw some boxes and arrows.</h2>
        <p class="arty-psmall">May 13, 2020</p>
        <hr class="arty-hr" />
        <p class="arty-p">Tables can get very complex very quickly. This fact, paired with a frequent desire to throw all possible features into a table (the kitchen sink table), creates a situation for project teams that quickly results in a poor user experience. Let me take a pause and say this in one line for dramatic effect:</p>
        <p class="arty-p"><strong>Avoid complex tables until absolutely, objectively necessary.</strong></p>
        <p class="arty-p">I can hear the knee-jerk reaction now: "But our customers need table feature A, table feature B, table feature C...!"</p>
        <p class="arty-p"><strong>No.</strong> No they do not. (read also as: not necessarily... to be more objective about it)</p>
        <p class="arty-p">People who use software need elegantly designed product experiences that do not throw them into an overwhelming interface that requires them to read a manual. Do people have time for that? If you asked the people who use your software, what would their answer be?</p>
        <p class="arty-p">So how do you avoid complex tables? Here are a few guidelines to mitigate unncessary table complexity.</p>
        <h3 class="arty-h3">1. Say "no" to adding table interactions</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Make it hard to add feature upon feature to tables. Instead of jumping to immediate solutions like "we need column filters!", say "no", and take an investigative approach. This gives you time and space to fully understand the true needs of people who maybe don't need column filters. They might just need you to discover and understand the unmet need of comparing items in a table by two very specific columns of information.</p>
        <h3 class="arty-h3">2. Focus on workflow</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">If you take a step back and very meticulously list out core workflows that a user needs to complete their tasks, you give yourself an entire new realm of possible experiences to create.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">Instead of a table with selection AND search AND column filters AND column view options AND being all responsive AND being all accessible (good luck, and don't get sued!), you map out diagrams of workflows independently and re-ask the question: "Does this really all need to be on one page with one component to rule them all?" (answer: nope!)</p>
        <p class="arty-p">Focus on workflow, and make it a point to create workflows that work in parallel with each other so that the flow of the experience, regardless of task, works similarly. You're still enabling the user to become extremely efficient in this way since cohesion in workflow is just as important, if not moreso, than consistency in features. Plus, you'll be setting yourself up for success with people who use small devices.</p>
        <h3 class="arty-h3">3. Assume people only use their phones</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">Building on the previous guideline, we have this last one. Small devices just don't have the same amount of luxurious space to design a complex, overly-information-dense interface. So if you assume (and work <em>with</em> and not against) this constraint, you design in a way that limits interaction and thus limits complexity. You simplify  the experience into managable steps that can be navigated screen-by-screen.</p>
        <h3 class="arty-h3">Not the guidelines you expected</h3>
        <p class="arty-p">By now it should be clear that table guidelines are not like you may have expected. It's not a question of "where do filters go on a page?" or "what's best to use: column filters or side panel filter?" The question is really a hard ask: are you doing enough to reduce complexity of the product experience by focusing more on understanding people to a depth where you don't need that complexity to begin with?</p>

        <h1 class="arty-h1">On the future of design leadership.</h1>
        <h2 class="arty-h2">Step up, and be <span class="span-strikethrough">political</span> collaborative.</h2>
        <p class="arty-psmall">May 12, 2020 modified and reposted from Feb 6, 2019</p>
        <hr class="arty-hr" />
        <p class="arty-p">The world, full of moral injustices, is hungry for leaders. In any organization, these injustices are woven throughout the workplace.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">People are aware of this. People see an enormous gap that needs to be filled. They see a problem that needs to be solved. They see a lack of true leadership, and they don’t see anyone stepping up.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">Leadership is a person who steps up.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">But in order to step up, in order for there to be leaders that resolve an injustice, people need to learn to be political within their organization.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">Humans organize into groups, and as immediately as that happens, that group is inherently political. There is governance that happens. There is no way around politics. There is no way around human social interaction and the dynamics thereof.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">How you execute being political is highly personal, and every person has their different style of implementing successful politics.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">But the world right now lacks a certain type of politics: collaborative, co-creative, holistic, systems-level, and long-term thinking politics.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">It's not about the authoritative "I" anymore. It never has been, though we may have forgotten. It's about the cohesive "we".</p>
        <p class="arty-p">You are a person who can step up with these flavors of politics.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">No matter where you’re at, or where you might want to go, you will need to define your style of collaborative politics to address what the world lacks.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">This is how you start.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">This is how we resolve injustices.</p>
        <p class="arty-p">This is how we define the world of tomorrow.</p>
